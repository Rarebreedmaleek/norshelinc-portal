You have done an excellent job so far. Now let's move on to building the **Parent Login Dashboard** for the Norshel web application.

🎯 Objective:
Create a secure, user-friendly, and interactive dashboard that displays essential information about each client to their respective parents after login.

👁️ What the parent should see (per client):
1. Client's image (displayed as a circular avatar or card-style profile)
2. Client's full name
3. Client's assigned Team (e.g., Team 1, Team 2, etc.)
4. Current Day of the Week (e.g., Wednesday)
5. Activities for that day:
   - Morning Activity (e.g., Movies)
   - Afternoon Activity (e.g., Bowling)
6. Weekly Lunch Menu (Monday to Friday), possibly in a side section or collapsible panel

📌 Example:
- **Client's Name**: John Doe  
- **Client's Team**: Team 2  
- **Day of the Week**: Wednesday  
- **Activities for Wednesday**:
   - Morning: Movies  
   - Afternoon: Bowling  
- **Lunch Menu**:
   - Monday: Rice & Beans  
   - Tuesday: Pasta  
   - Wednesday: Chicken Wrap  
   - Thursday: Sandwich  
   - Friday: Pizza

💡 Design Instructions:
- Use clean, card-based layout or grid to show client details.
- Include a small sidebar or section for lunch menu.
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive and beautiful styling.
- Highlight today’s day in the UI using color or badge.
- The page must only be visible to **authenticated parents** using the login system.
- Support multiple clients per parent account (if needed).

Start by creating the `dashboard.html` (or route `/dashboard`) with secure backend access, and a clean frontend layout displaying the above data.
