## How to Replace the Login Background Image

I've updated your login page design to use the beautiful image you provided as the background. However, I need you to manually save the image file to complete the setup.

### Steps:

1. **Save the Image**:
   - Right-click on the image you uploaded in the chat
   - Select "Save image as..."
   - Navigate to: `C:\Users\rareb\OneDrive\Desktop\NorshelCursor\static\`
   - Save it as: `norshel-clients.jpg`
   - Replace the existing placeholder file when prompted

2. **Verify the Setup**:
   - The login page is already configured to use `/static/norshel-clients.jpg`
   - Once you save the image, refresh your browser
   - You should see the beautiful background with the two clients smiling

### Design Features Added:

âœ… **Full-screen background image** showing Norshel clients  
âœ… **Semi-transparent overlay** for better text readability  
âœ… **Glassmorphism login form** with backdrop blur effect  
âœ… **Enhanced typography** with drop shadows  
âœ… **Improved button design** with hover effects  
âœ… **Descriptive text** explaining the portal's purpose  

### Current Login Page URL:
- **HTTPS**: https://localhost:8443/login
- **HTTP**: http://localhost:8000/login (redirects to HTTPS)

The image perfectly captures the joy and connection that Norshel provides, making it an ideal background for parents logging in to check on their loved ones! ðŸŒŸ

**After saving the image, your login page will have a beautiful, professional appearance that reflects Norshel's caring mission.**
