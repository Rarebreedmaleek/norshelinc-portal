You have done a perfect job. Now, letâ€™s improve the **homepage** of this Norshel web application to make it more **user-friendly and visually engaging**.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
- Enhance the existing homepage by applying a more modern, accessible, and interactive layout.
- Use a professional yet friendly **template or background**, suitable for an organization supporting adults with developmental and physical disabilities.
- Maintain clean, readable typography and warm colors that reflect compassion and care.

ðŸ“Œ Keep this content visible:
- "Welcome to Norshel Inc."
- "Supporting adults with physical and developmental disabilities since 1983"
- "Who We Are" section with the list of disabilities supported.
- Contact and navigation menu (Home, Programs, Individualized Programming, Sign Language, Contact, Login).

âœ¨ Design Improvements:
- Add a subtle animated background or gradient (avoid distraction).
- Include iconography (e.g., heart, support, diversity) near sections for better visual cues.
- Use hover effects on navigation and interactive elements.
- Make the layout responsive for mobile/tablet.
- Optionally, add a "Learn More" button that scrolls to "Hours of Operation" or "Programs."

Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsiveness. You can also use **simple Python for any animations or interactivity** if needed.

Start by redesigning the homepage (`index.html`) and the CSS styles.
