I am building a secure web application in Python (using FastAPI) to support my company Norshel, an organization that helps adults with physical and developmental disabilities.

Generate the full starter code and project structure for this app, using FastAPI for the backend, HTML + Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and host on this my windows Machine.

**App Features:**

1. Secure Login System:
   - Only parents can log in to view private dashboards.
   - Use JWT-based authentication.
   - Unauthenticated users see only the landing page (public).

2. Dashboard (for logged-in parents only):
   - Display a weekly schedule (Monday to Friday) showing:
     - Teams (Team 1–5), staff names, and assigned activities.
     - Clients assigned to teams, their names, and daily activities.
   - This information should come from a structured backend (DB or mock data).

3. Sign Language Page:
   - A public page that shows an embedded video of a lady demonstrating sign language A-Z.

4. Frontend:
   - Create simple, responsive HTML pages using Tailwind CSS.
   - Pages:
     - index.html → Landing page with company info
     - login.html → Login form
     - dashboard.html → Secure dashboard (only accessible after login)
     - video.html → Sign language video

5. Backend API endpoints:
   - `/login` – Parent login with JWT response
   - `/dashboard` – Return JSON of schedule and team data (secured)
   - `/clients` – Return list of clients and their team assignments (secured)

6. Folder structure:

    ├── backend/
    │ ├── main.py
    │ ├── models.py
    │ ├── auth.py

    │ └── sign_language.mp4
    │
    ├── .env
    └── requirements.txt


Please generate:
- The initial backend code with working FastAPI endpoints.
- JWT-based auth with simple user role check.
- Tailwind-styled HTML templates with navigation and sample layout.
- Mock data for staff, teams, and clients to test the dashboard.

Make sure the code is clean, modular, and ready for me to deploy on this my window machine, and provide me with a LINK to test my website
